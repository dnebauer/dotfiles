The original version of the utility `find-cursor` is located in github
repository [arp242/find-cursor][arp242-repo]. The files located here are
sourced from the repository [dnebauer/find-cursor][dnebauer-repo]. The forked
repository contains manpage and zsh completion files, as well as the bugfix
documented in project [issue #28][issue-28].

The `find-cursor` file was built from a local repository copy located in the
local [utility projects directory][build-dir].

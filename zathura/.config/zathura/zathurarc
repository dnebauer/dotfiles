# on 11 May 2024 a debian upgrade of zathura advised the plain database
# setting was deprecated and advised setting the database backend to sqlite
#
# after the upgrade, zathura wrote the following messages to console
# on each startup:
#   info: Opening plain database via sqlite backend.
#   warning: sqlite database already exists. Set your database backend to sqlite
#
# these messages ceased after adding the following configuration setting
# as per "man 4 zathurarc"
set database sqlite

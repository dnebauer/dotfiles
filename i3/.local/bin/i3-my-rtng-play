=head1 NAME

i3-my-rtng-play - play or pause a Radiotray NG station

=head1 USAGE

B<i3-my-rtng-play>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Uses the S<Radiotray NG> DBus interface to play the last station if none is
currently playing, or pause the current station if one is currently playing.

Attempts to set the volume to the configured default value for the station.
See L<App::Dn::RTNG::Play> for further details.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Uses a configuration file with the file name stem 'rtng-play-change' placed in
one of the usual configuration file locations.
(See L<File::ConfigDir> and L<Config::Any> for further details.)

Any of the file formats supported by L<Config::Any> can be used.
Configuration support is limited to default volume set on a per station basis.
There must be a section called 'volume' within which are key:value pairs where
keys are station names and values are corresponding volumes.
The volume values can be any format supported by C<pactl>.

Here is an example configuration file located in
S<< F<$HOME/.config/rtng-play-change.json> >>:

    {
      "volume": {
        "ABC Country": "40%",
        "Country 108": "25%"
      }
    }

# configuration file for udiskie

---

program_options:

  # Configure defaults for command line options

  tray: auto          # [bool] Enable the tray icon. "auto" means auto-hide the
  #                     tray icon when there are no handled devices.

  menu: nested        # ["flat" | "nested"] Set the systray menu behaviour.

  automount: true     # [bool] Enable automatic mounting.

  notify: true        # [bool] Enable notifications.

  password_cache: 30  # [int] Password cache in minutes.
  #                     Caching is disabled by default.
  #                     It can be disabled explicitly by setting it to false.

  file_manager: dolphin
  # [string] Set program to open directories. It will be invoked
  # with the folder path as its last command line argument.

  terminal: ''
  # [string] Set terminal command line to open directories. It will be invoked
  # with the folder path as its last command line argument.

  password_prompt: "builtin:gui"
  # [string|list] Set command to retrieve passwords. If specified as a list it
  # defines the ARGV array for the program call. If specified as a string, it
  # will be expanded in a shell-like manner. Each string will be formatted
  # using `str.format`. For a list of device attributes, see below. The two
  # special string values "builtin:gui" and "builtin:tty" signify to use
  # udiskie's builtin password prompt.

  notify_command: "notify-send '{event}' '{device_presentation}'"
  # [string|list] Set command to be executed on any device event.
  # This is specified like `password_prompt`.

device_config:

  # List of device option rules. Each item can match any combination of device
  # attributes. Additionally, it defines the resulting action (see below). Any
  # rule can contain multiple filters (AND) and multiple actions. Only the
  # first matching rule that defines a given action is used. The rules defined
  # here are simply prepended to the builtin device rules, so that it is
  # possible to completely overwrite the defaults by specifying a catch-all
  # rule (i.e. a rule without device attributes).

  # Ignore mounted debian distro iso images

  # specified event:
